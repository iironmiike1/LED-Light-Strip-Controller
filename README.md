# LED-Light-Strip-Controller
Red, Green, Blue, and White Light Strip Controller.  The hardware is based on a 2A 12V power supply, Arduino Nano microcontroller, and four // IRLB8721 MOSFET drivers. There are two light strips; one is white and the other is RGB.  There is one MOSFET for each color, each controlled by a PWM pin from the Nano.
